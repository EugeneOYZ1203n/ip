Boop is a desktop app for managing tasks, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while retaining GUI benefits. If you can type fast, Boop makes task management efficient, fun, and engaging.

## Quick start

1.  Ensure you have **Java 17 or above** installed on your computer.
2.  Download the latest Boop `.jar` file from [Releases](https://github.com/EugeneOYZ1203n/ip/releases).
3.  Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder with the downloaded `.jar` file, and run:

    ```bash
    java -jar boop.jar
    ```

4.  A GUI similar to the screenshot above should appear.
5.  Type commands into the command box and press **Enter** to execute.

    Example commands you can try:

    - `list` : Lists all tasks.
    - `todo Finish CS2103T iP` : Adds a new Todo task.
    - `deadline Submit report /by 2025-09-30` : Adds a Deadline task.
    - `event Party /from 18:00 /to 23:00` : Adds an Event task.
    - `undo` : Undoes the last action.
    - `bye` : Exits Boop.

## Features

:information_source: **Notes about the command format**:

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters.  
   Example: in `todo TASK`, `TASK` is a parameter.
- Commands are case-sensitive.

- Aliases are provided for some flags, they will be included in the format as `/flag/f` where both `/flag` and `/f` are valid
  Example: `deadline Submit report /by 2025-09-30` and `deadline Submit report /b 2025-09-30` are both valid

- Index numbering starts from 1. When in doubt use `list` and follow the numbering given there
